\section*{\textcolor{BlueViolet}{Motivation Letter}}
\vspace{0.7cm}
Dear Prof. Plopski, dear selection committee,

\vspace{0.5cm}
I would love to participate in the summer Bachelor program at the IVC institute. A couple of years ago, I worked at a company where we used ML in \textbf{image processing} â€“ I really enjoyed that experience, especially comparing different models and exploring what works best. Since then, I've been programming regularly and looking forward to applying my skills in a medical context.

I'm currently finishing my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering and have already started working on my thesis under the supervision of Marc Masana.
The project is still in its early stages, but I began with the implementation. My current idea focuses on \textbf{skin lesion classification} using \textbf{machine learning}. The pipeline structure is described bellow.

I'm very motivated to better my knowledge in \textbf{Computer Vision} area and would be excited to work on it during the summer program. 

In case other details are needed, here is my \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/taisiya-parkhomenko-937336167/}{LinkedIn} profile. 
The \hyperlink{commitment}{commitment of supervision} and the \hyperlink{transcript}{transcript of records} are attached.

Thank you and best regards!\\

\section*{\textcolor{BlueViolet}{Thesis: Skin Lesion Classification with ML Pipeline}}
\vspace{0.7cm}
The idea is to build a multi-step pipeline for automatic skin lesion classification.\\
Structure:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Use SAM2 encoder to extract features from skin images
    \item Classify images as skin vs. non-skin
    \item If skin:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[-] Classify lesion type (e.g., keratosis, carcinoma)
        \item[-] Predict benign vs. malignant
    \end{itemize}
    \item Use segmentation masks for interpretability and better localization
\end{enumerate}
